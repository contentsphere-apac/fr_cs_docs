the basis for the context sensitive help and tooltips within the application.

* :doc:`Tutorials </tutorials/index>` take you by the hand through a series of steps to work within the **Contentsphere** application.

  Also look at the **note** `new-to-contentsphere`_ below

* :doc:`Feature guides </feature/index>` discuss key features and concepts at a fairly high level and provide
  useful background information and explanation, including key user stories.

* :doc:`Reference guides </reference/index>` contain technical reference for implementation and support of the
  application other aspects of **Contentsphere’s** machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume
  that you have a basic understanding of key concepts

* :doc:`How to guides </how/index>` are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems
  and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how **Contentsphere** works.
